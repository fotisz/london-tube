# Welcome

Transport for London's Open Data repository was recently valued by Deloitte
as providing up to [Â£130mil of economic benefits][1] for the City of London by
allowing 600 third-party transport apps access to real-time transit information
via a common Application Programming Interface.

This project is split into two parts which tackle various analytical methods
and visualisations applied to a segment of this API; network timetabling data.

The dataset being explored is a live feed of the Transport for London
network timetables. As described on the TfL website:

> The Journey Planner timetable feed contains up-to-date standard
> timetables for London Underground, bus, DLR, TfL Rail and river
> services. The timetables are updated every seven days. 

The dataset is freely available and is bound by the [TfL Open Data License](https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/terms-and-conditions/transport-data-service).

## Part One: Managing Data

Prior to any form of analysis, we need a structured, rectangular dataset.
The first part of the project involves building a reproducible workflow for
refreshing the timetable API feed which is updated on a weekly basis.
It starts with examining the structure of the data source before
extracting all of the relevant data into a "tidy" and normalised format,
adding any additional variables and typecasting extracted information
ready for pushing to a PostgreSQL database for further analysis.
This notebook is written in R for the data manipulation
and PostgreSQL for in-database transformation.

For the purposes of this project, only London Underground timetables are extracted
and processed however the methods presented here extend to any tube, train,
bus, ferry or tram timetable across Great Britain as the extraction process
is built around a generic XML schema used by the UK Department for Transport.

## Part Two: Visualising Data

Once the data has been extracted, cleaned and normalised, the
second part looks at different ways to visualise network timetable data
and apply journey planner algorithms to calculate the fastest routes
to get across London. Specifically, the notebook compares the depiction
of the famous London Underground map with a visualisation of the tube lines
and stations in reality and uses this plot to illustrate the movement of
train vehicles over time through spatiotemporal animation.

As with any data science project, the vast majority
of the time is spent performing tasks from Part One however equal weight
has been given to each in the resulting notebooks in terms of content.

## Context

This project was completed in partial fulfilment of a course for the MSc Analytics and
Operations Research at the London School of Economics. Any analysis presented here
was designed foremost to align to the course principles and methodologies covered.

The requirements of the course are to provide the analysis in the form of exploratory
notebooks (Part One and Two respectively) however in the interests of full reproducibility
of the project all additional analysis files are included with a script outlining
the overall workflow.

The course content covered in Part One is

- Using data from the Internet, parsing XML web data (Week 4)
- Working with APIs and authentication (Week 5)
- Manipulation, transformation and extraction of data into "tidy" form (Week 2)
- Relational databases and table normalisation (Week 3)

Part Two looks at

- Exploratory data visualisation using Matplotlib (Weeks 7 and 8)
- Graph algorithms and visualisation (Week 11)
- Querying RESTful APIs and parsing JSON data (Weeks 4 and 5)

The content from Week 1

- Version control, website publishing and GitHub pages

is inherent in the publication of this website.
