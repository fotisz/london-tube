    "The London Undergroup map is 86 years old and is considered one of the [great icons of British design](http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/01_january/27/culture.shtml). Virtually every public\n",

    "\n",
    "It's pretty perfect for easily trying to find out which lines to take and which stations to transfer at to get across London however what it doesn't show, is\n",
    "the relative distances and travel times between each of those stations which can sometimes lead to suboptimal route planning.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to get from Paddington to Bond Street, there are two clear (seemingly equidistant) routes on the map; via Baker St or via Notting Hill Gate. As we will explore, they are **not** equidistant and can significantly exacerbate journey time if the wrong route is chosen.\n",
    "\n",
    "To visualise the underground map using the cleaned dataset from Part One, we need the list of stations along with\n",
    "the possible links from each station to another. It's enough to just look at the longest \"inbound\" route for each line because (we would hope) that the \"outbound\" route is identical. This is provided by the [`inbound_graph`](InboundGraph.html) PostgreSQL view.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, create an empty MultiGraph which allows for multiple links between two stations. For instance, Liverpool St to Farringdon is served by three separate lines."

    "\n",
    "Eyeballing a geographically-accurate map of the network isn't *really* the best way to work out the fastest route from Paddington to Bond Street. The more accurate way would be to weight each edge of our network by the travel time between the two stations and then use a shortest path graph algorithm to find the sequence of edges from station A to station B with the smallest total weight (ie travel time).\n",
    "\n",
    "It's worth noting that despite the misleading name of \"shortest path\", since we don't really care how *far* we travel, we want to weight by time rather than distance to get to our destination the fastest way, not the shortest way.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one more factor to consider though because modelling the shortest path this way assumes that there is a train ready and waiting to go the moment you want to leave and at every station at which you transfer. With the exception of the Central line in peak hour, this is almost never the case in any transportation network.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formulation**\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, we model the tube stations using a time-expanded graph network where each node represents a station-*event* rather than a station. In other words, there is a \"Hyde Park Corner\" node for every arrival and departure of every vehicle into and out of that station. When we lumped WaitTime in with RunTime to create JourneyTime, we simplified the problem to assume that the train's arrival and departure is instantaneous so there's no need to create *both* a departure *and* arrival node.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then we have two types of edges:\n",
    "- Travel Edge: Represents the movement of a train from one station to the next\n",
    "- Stay Edge: Represents waiting at a station for the immediately next train to depart. Effectively these are chained\n",
    "between all successive departures out of a given station throughout the day so that we can wait for any successive train at that station and not just the very next one to leave.\n",
